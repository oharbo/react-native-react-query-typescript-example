This  [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project is bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Backend service

This project contains a default backend service that provides a vehicle list and vehicle detail information. You can run the service in a Docker container from the root of this project by running:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

The following endpoints are available to use:

* http://localhost:8485/api/vehicles/
* http://localhost:8485/api/vehicles/$id/

>**Note**: you might need to replace "localhost" with your machine IP address to reach the endpoints
